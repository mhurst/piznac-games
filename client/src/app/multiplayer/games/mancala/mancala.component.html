    <h3>How to Play</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Click one of your pits to pick up all its stones.</li>
      <li>Stones are dropped one at a time going counter-clockwise.</li>
      <li>Your opponent's store is skipped when dropping stones.</li>
      <li>If your last stone lands in your store, you get an extra turn.</li>
      <li>If your last stone lands in an empty pit on your side and the opposite pit has stones, you capture both into your store.</li>
      <li>The game ends when one side is completely empty. Remaining stones go to that side's store.</li>
      <li>The player with the most stones in their store wins!</li>
    </ul>
